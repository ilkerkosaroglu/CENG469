Deferred shading - G buffer - Multiple Passes

bernstein shader: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsKXDK

total number of vertices per draw = 1
total number of triangles per draw = 80*80*2
max sample number = 80

offsetleri nasıl  yapcam, total size lazım. nasıl fitliyoruz ekrana?

which way is up?

tried to draw simple triangle. Nothing was showing.
Figured rasterizer couldn't do it (why?)

Turns out, gl_vertexID was per vertex sent to gpu, not drawn. Makes sense because
it is processed in parallel.

Increased my vertex count from 1 to 80*80*6
Worked!
